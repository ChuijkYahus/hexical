# Hexical
At time of writing, I believe Hexical is the biggest, most feature-rich, and most fleshed-out Hexcasting addon in existence. It is my passion project, developing for a mod I greatly enjoy and with little rhyme or reason to anything's inclusion other than what I thought would be fun. When I played Hexcasting, I found where were certain gaps that I felt a Hexcaster ( essentially a magician ) should be able to do. Conjure flowers, flick levers remotely, dye blocks, whittle magical trinkets out of crystals, cast by waving their arms, etc... I added these features and slowly, I created a bit of a philosophy for Hexcasting. I developed my own interpretation of Hexcasting that is; what things should be easy to obtain that are currently hard, what powerful features to add but gate behind understanding barriers, and what features to add just for fun. I wanted to make an addon that filled in the holes of the Hexcasting experience for me.

I believe I have managed to do that. Judging my its popularity, it seems other people feel the same. Enjoy :]
