	"hexical.page.hexical_changes": "Hexical Changes",
	"hexical.page.hexical_changes.1": "The media feels different somehow, almost friendly. I feel strangely more receptive of the ambient media around me. I can even feel it responding to certain tasks I perform, as if new spells are available to me.",
	"hexical.page.hexical_changes.2": "The media has also become more adaptable, letting me manipulate it more precisely into specialized effects and even interface with items like my abacus.",

	"hexical.category.lamp": "Genieless Lamp",
	"hexical.category.lamp.desc": "I have heard tales from the villagers about a magical artifact. Legends say it contains a spirit that grants wishes, but I suspect that is just embellishment evolved over centuries of storytelling. Regardless, I dedicate this chapter to my pursuit and research of it.",

	"hexical.page.mysterious_lamp": "Mysterious Lamp",
	"hexical.page.mysterious_lamp.1": "At last I've discovered the subject of a thousand years of rumor! The lamp emanates a vague residue of media, vacuous in feeling... it reminds me of the $(o)hollow media structure$() of a focus that enables it to store iota, but there is also a presence inside.",
	"hexical.page.new_possibilities": "New Possibilities",
	"hexical.page.new_possibilities.1": "It casts $(o)$(l)EVERY INSTANT$(). After writing a spell into it, I was treated to a splendid gush of media. I estimate it must be around twenty times every second. The presence inside the lamp performs the casting on my behalf with extraordinarily efficience, not wasting media in the form of sound and particles that accompany other casting methods.",
	"hexical.page.new_possibilities.2": "I have deduced some useful patterns for use with the lamp, documented on the next few pages.",
	"hexical.page.master_lamps": "Master Lamps",
	"hexical.page.master_lamps.1": "Because a separate mind casts my spells, a lamp should be able to cast even without me holding it. I estimate any villager short of a complete master of its field would be unable to cast so often unassisted though. These $(o)master lamps$() are activated and deactivated rather than used and while they're active in my inventory, they will cast every moment without my input.",
	"hexical.page.master_lamps.2": "The output of a master lamp is so grand that it saturates the air around me with media... it's incredible. Unfortunately, if two lamps are active at once within my inventory, the resonances clash violently and causes a runaway chain that leads to a magical explosion, sapping almost five charged amethyst and violently repelling mobs, but strangely leaving blocks unharmed. To prevent such a cascade, I should only have one master lamp active at once, although I can still simutaneously use a regular lamp.",

	"hexical.page.get_lamp_position": "Pushes the original position of the caster when the lamp started casting.",
	"hexical.page.get_lamp_rotation": "Pushes the original rotation of the caster when the lamp started casting.",

	"hexical.page.get_lamp_use_time": "Pushes how many times the lamp has casted. Divided by 20, it returns how many times in seconds the lamp has been in use.",

	"hexical.page.get_master_lamp_position": "Pushes the original position of the caster when the master lamp started casting. Can be cast by casting items or staff.",
	"hexical.page.get_master_lamp_rotation": "Pushes the original rotation of the caster when the master lamp started casting. Can be cast by casting items or staff.",
	"hexical.page.get_master_lamp_velocity": "Pushes the original velocity of the caster when the master lamp started casting. Can be cast by casting items or staff.",
	"hexical.page.get_master_lamp_use_time": "Pushes how many times the lamp has casted. Divided by 20, it returns how many times in seconds the lamp has been in use. Can be cast by casting items or staff.",
	"hexical.page.is_using_lamp": "Takes a player and pushes whether they currently have an active master lamp.",
	"hexical.page.terminate_master_lamp": "Casted by a casting device, staff, or within the master lamp, deactivates the lamp's operation. Similar to Charon's.",

    "hexical.page.replacement_mind": "Replacement Mind",
    "hexical.page.replacement_mind.1": "Hex casting burns the mind from the energy of thought, flooding the mind, inundating every neuron... it's euphoric. For staffs, casting devices, and spell circles, the rate of casting is slow enough for a mind to recuperate, but with the speeds this lamp promises, even an optimized mind can only bear the burden for so long. As if to reflect the mind's deterioration, the lamp itself tarnishes until it becomes unusable. In these cases, the genie must be... replaced.",
    "hexical.page.replacement_mind.2": "I have adapted Flay Mind to flay the mind into my magic lamp. The stress of nonstop casting requires highly trained villagers, I estimate of Journeyman-class or greater. The lamp may not be recharged without sacrificing a new mind, discarding the previous mind in the process, so I should aim to gather as much media as I can before casting.",

	"hexical.page.hexical_metaevals": "Hexical Meta-evaluations",
	"hexical.page.nephthys.1": "Pops a pattern list and a number from the stack and dives down n iota to casts the pattern list. Useful for surgery-like operations.",
	"hexical.page.nephthys.2": "It's extremely versatile and I can mend almost any error in my stack using Bookkeeper's Gambit, pushing iota after a dive, and transforming surfaced iota. It was named after a goddess of mourning and rivers, lending to how it buries/dives down into the stack.",

	"hexical.page.advanced_conjuration": "Advanced Conjuration",
	"hexical.page.advanced_conjuration.1": "While Conjure Block is an interesting spell, it has multiple shortcomings. The blocks stay around forever, are a mess to clean up, and don't have many interesting properties.",
	"hexical.page.conjure_advanced_block": "Luckily, Nature offers an elegant and flexible solution. These advanced blocks come with a suite of $(o)modifiers$(). I could even stack multiple modifiers on one block.",
	"hexical.page.modify_block_bouncy": "This modifier makes the block delightfully fun to bounce on! It returns more force to me than regular slime blocks and I notice even if I sneak, the block bounces me regardless.",
	"hexical.page.modify_block_ephemeral": "This modifier takes in a number as well as a position and makes the block destroy itself after the number in twentieths of a second has passed. No more messy floating blocks!",
	"hexical.page.modify_block_invisible": "This modifier prevents the block from emiting the telltale particles, even when being stood on.",
	"hexical.page.modify_block_volatile": "This modifier makes the block break other conjured blocks it's touching. Notably, if it breaks another volatile block, the chain continues down until every volatile block shatters.",

	"hexical.page.chorus_blink.1": "Between Blink, Greater Teleport, ender pearls, and chorus fruit, this spell serves a harmonious midpoint for safe, precise, and cheap teleportation.",
	"hexical.page.chorus_blink.2": "It consumes a chorus fruit from my inventory and teleports me up to 16 blocks using an offset vector. The cost is constant whether I teleport the full 16 blocks or less, and has no penalty for multiple casts in one hex. With a lot of chorus fruit, it can be a significantly cheaper Greater Teleport.",

	"hexical.page.conjure_staff.1": "Conjures a staff at the location with the amount of media, rank, and hex respectively.",
	"hexical.page.conjure_staff.2": "A conjured staff is not unlike a cypher. It has a media bank that it relies on for casting and breaks when it runs out, unable to consume my health or my inventory's media. It is not rechargable or programmable. Using erase item on it simply destroys it. However, its true power is $(o)input interception$().",
	"hexical.page.conjure_staff.3": "When I use my primary or secondary use keys with a staff in my main hand, it intercepts my click. Depending on the rank I assigned during creation, after that many clicks, it will cast the hex I gave it, starting the stack with false and true, corresponding to my left and right clicks respectively.",
	"hexical.page.conjure_staff.4": "The spell is not cheap, requiring a charged amethyst, the media battery, and an additional amethyst shard for every additional rank. However, the conjured result is both speedy and versatile, with infinitely more possibilities and none of the cooldown of other casting devices."
