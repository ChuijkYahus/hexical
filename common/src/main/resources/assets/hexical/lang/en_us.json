	"hexcasting.mishap.hexical:grimoire_too_full": "Tried to fit too many bindings in a grimoire.",

	"hexical.page.hexical_changes.title": "Hexical Changes",
	"hexical.page.hexical_changes.0": "I feel strangely more receptive of the ambient media around me. It feels $(o)friendlier$() somehow... I can even feel it responding to certain actions, as if suggesting new spells to me. I also notice I require less concentration with my staff and can move around while using it. Unfortunately, Nature has not become more forgiving of my mishaps.",
	"hexical.page.hexical_changes.1": "The media has also become more malleable, letting me manipulate it precisely into specific specialized effects. I can also interface with my abacus using Scribe's Gambit.",

	"hexical.page.grimoire.title": "Grimoires",
	"hexical.page.grimoire.0": "By encrusting my spellbook with charged amethyst and edified wood, it traps media within the pages like an echo chamber. I can then introduce a pattern-to-pattern-list binding for the grimoire to keep bouncing endlessly inside.",
	"hexical.page.grimoire.1": "When I then cast the pattern associated with a pattern list with my staff and the grimoire in my inventory, it empowers the pattern, allowing it to break free from the grimoire's pages with a faint sound of a hex being cast. This allows me to create $(o)shortcuts$() for my staff by associating a short pattern with a common task, such as the raycast mantra. Interestingly, the grimoire can even overwrite base patterns, allowing me to hijack and add extra functionality to them.",
	"hexical.page.grimoire.2": "While stable with only a few abstract strands of media wizzing around inside, a single grimoire can not hold more than sixteen pattern associations. When attempting to introduce more, the grimoire simply rejects it and throws itself onto the ground with a shower of blue sparks.",
	"hexical.page.grimoire.3": "I can also restrict a pattern inside the grimoire so it destroys itself after a certain number of uses. I shall find this aspect of the grimoire quite useful if I ever need to lend out my true name. I can simply give them a grimoire a set number of references to my name.",
    "hexical.page.write_grimoire": "Writes a pattern-to-pattern-list binding into the grimoire in my offhand.",

	"hexical.category.lamp": "Genieless Lamp",
	"hexical.category.lamp.desc": "I have heard tales from the villagers about a magical artifact. Legends say it contains a spirit that grants wishes, but I suspect that is just embellishment evolved over centuries of storytelling. Regardless, I dedicate this chapter to my pursuit and research of it.",

	"hexical.page.mysterious_lamp.title": "Mysterious Lamp",
	"hexical.page.mysterious_lamp.0": "At last I've discovered the subject of a thousand years of rumor! To think a wandering trader was in possession of such a strong artifact. The lamp emanates a vague residue of media, vacuous in feeling... it reminds me of the $(o)hollow media structure$() of a focus that enables it to store iota, but there is also a presence inside with spellcasting capabilities similar to my own.",
	"hexical.page.mysterious_lamp.1": "Teaches the genie my intentions. Because I am teaching rather than etching a casting device with my will, I can freely revise the hex any time without losing the media.",

	"hexical.page.new_possibilities.title": "New Possibilities",
	"hexical.page.new_possibilities.0": "It casts $(o)$(l)EVERY INSTANT$(). After writing a spell into it, I was treated to a splendid gush of media. I estimate the casting speed must be around twenty times every second. The presence inside the lamp performs the casting on my behalf with extraordinary efficiency, not producing the sound and particles that accompany other casting methods.",
	"hexical.page.new_possibilities.1": "I have developed some useful patterns for use with the lamp, documented on the next few pages. These patterns should only be cast from within the lamp, lest I succumb to the Missing Genie mishap, which emits red sparks and flings my casting item from my hand.",
	"hexical.page.get_lamp_position": "Pushes the original position of the caster when the lamp started casting.",
	"hexical.page.get_lamp_rotation": "Pushes the original rotation of the caster when the lamp started casting.",
	"hexical.page.get_lamp_velocity": "Pushes the original velocity of the caster when the lamp started casting.",
	"hexical.page.get_lamp_use_time": "Pushes how many times the lamp has casted. Divided by 20, it returns how many times in seconds the lamp has been in use.",
	"hexical.page.get_lamp_media": "Pushes the remaining media of the lamp in dust, in terms of dust.",

	"hexical.page.replacement_mind.title": "Replacement Mind",
	"hexical.page.replacement_mind.0": "Hex casting burns out the mind from the energy of thought, flooding the consciousness, inundating every neuron... it's euphoric. For staffs, casting devices, and spell circles, the rate of casting is slow enough that a mind can recuperate; I will never need to replace my mind or an impetus. With the speeds this lamp operates at, though, even an optimized mind can only bear the burden for so long. Luckily, the lamp is able to somehow support the mind until its media battery runs out, where the genie finally perishes and the lamp visibly tarnishes. In these cases, the genie must be... replaced.",
	"hexical.page.replacement_mind.1": "Basing off the shape of the other genie patterns and the $(o)feeling$() of the media, I have developed this highly specialized pattern that extracts the mind of a villager and transforms it into a genie. The stress of nonstop casting requires highly trained villagers, I estimate of Journeyman-class or greater. The lamp may not be recharged without sacrificing a new mind, discarding the previous genie in the process, so I should aim to gather as much media as I can before casting.",

	"hexical.page.arch_lamps.title": "Arch Lamps",
	"hexical.page.arch_lamps.0": "Because a separate mind casts my spells, a lamp should be able to cast even without me holding it. I estimate any villager short of a complete master of its field would be unable to cast so often unassisted though. These $(o)arch lamps$() are activated and deactivated rather than used and while active in my inventory, they cast every moment even without my input.",
	"hexical.page.arch_lamps.1": "The output of an arch lamp is so grand that it saturates the air around me with media... it's incredible. Unfortunately, if two lamps are active at once within my inventory, the resonances clash and deactivate both lamps, as well as rendering every arch lamp in my inventory useless for a few seconds. I should only have one archgenie lamp active at once, although I can still simutaneously use a regular lamp.",

	"hexical.page.get_arch_lamp_position": "Pushes the original position of the caster when the arch lamp started casting.",
	"hexical.page.get_arch_lamp_rotation": "Pushes the original rotation of the caster when the arch lamp started casting.",
	"hexical.page.get_arch_lamp_velocity": "Pushes the original velocity of the caster when the arch lamp started casting.",
	"hexical.page.get_arch_lamp_use_time": "Pushes how many times the lamp has casted. Divided by 20, it returns how many times in seconds the lamp has been in use.",
	"hexical.page.get_arch_lamp_media": "Pushes the remaining amount of media left in the lamp, in terms of dust.",
	"hexical.page.is_using_lamp": "Pushes whether a player currently has an active arch lamp.",
	"hexical.page.terminate_arch_lamp": "Can be casted by a casting device, staff, or within the arch lamp itself. Deactivates the lamp's operation, similar to Charon's.",

	"hexical.page.arch_lamp_storage.title": "Arch Lamp Memory",
	"hexical.page.arch_lamp_storage": "The arch lamp continues to impress me with its capabilities! It supports an iota storage similar to the Ravenmind, persisting between ticks. If I need to remember an iota between casts of the lamp, I can stash it in here. The two patterns responsible can also be cast by a staff or casting device if an arch lamp is active.",
	"hexical.page.set_arch_lamp_storage": "Sets the lamp's iota storage. Subject to Transgress Others mishap unfortunately.",
	"hexical.page.get_arch_lamp_storage": "Gets the lamp's iota storage.",

	"hexical.page.hexical_metaevals": "Hexical Meta-evaluations",
	"hexical.page.nephthys.0": "Pops a pattern list and a number from the stack and dives down n iota to casts the pattern list. Useful for surgery-like operations.",
	"hexical.page.nephthys.1": "It's extremely versatile and I can mend almost any error in my stack using Bookkeeper's Gambit, pushing iota after a dive, and transforming surfaced iota. It was named after a goddess of mourning and rivers, lending to how it buries/dives down into the stack.",

	"hexical.page.mage_block.title": "Mage Blocks",
	"hexical.page.mage_block": "While interesting, Conjure Block has multiple shortcomings. The blocks last forever, are consequently a pain to clean up, and lack interesting properties. Luckily, Nature offers an elegant and flexible solution. These mage blocks come with a suite of $(o)modifiers$(). I could even stack multiple modifiers on one block.",
	"hexical.page.conjure_mage_block": "Conjures a generic mage block at the location. Costs three dust.",
	"hexical.page.modify_block_bouncy": "This modifier makes the block delightfully fun to bounce on! It returns more force to me than regular slime blocks and I notice even if I sneak, the block bounces me regardless.",
	"hexical.page.modify_block_ephemeral": "This modifier takes in a number as well as a position and makes the block destroy itself after the number in twentieths of a second has passed. No more messy floating blocks!",
	"hexical.page.modify_block_invisible": "This modifier prevents the block from emiting the telltale particles, even when being stood on.",
	"hexical.page.modify_block_replaceable": "This modifier is useful for construction! With this modifier applied, I find I can easily place another block in the place of a conjured block.",
	"hexical.page.modify_block_volatile": "This modifier makes the block break other conjured blocks it's touching. Notably, if it breaks another volatile block, the chain continues down until every volatile block shatters.",

	"hexical.page.chorus_blink.0": "Between Blink, Greater Teleport, ender pearls, and chorus fruit, this spell serves a harmonious midpoint for safe, precise, and cheap teleportation.",
	"hexical.page.chorus_blink.1": "It consumes a chorus fruit from my inventory and teleports me up to 16 blocks using an offset vector. The cost is constant whether I teleport the full 16 blocks or less, and has no penalty for multiple casts in one hex. With a lot of chorus fruit, it can be a significantly cheaper Greater Teleport.",

	"hexical.page.entity_purifications.title": "Entity Purifications",
	"hexical.page.entity_purifications": "I have discovered a few more specialized entity purifications that allow me to divine extra information about an entity.",
	"hexical.page.is_burning": "Pushes whether the entity is burning.",
	"hexical.page.burning_time": "Pushes how long the entity will continue burning if not put out.",
	"hexical.page.is_wet": "Pushes whether the entity is touching rain, water, or in a bubble column.",
	"hexical.page.is_sprinting": "Pushes whether the player is sprinting. Interestingly, that includes swimming or if I started sprinting but left the ground.",

	"hexical.page.conjure_staff.0": "Conjures a staff at the location with the amount of media, rank, and hex respectively.",
	"hexical.page.conjure_staff.1": "Conjured staves are not unlike cyphers. They have a media battery for casting and when they run out, unable to consume my health or my inventory's stash for media. They are not rechargable or reprogrammable, and using Erase Item on it simply destroys it. However, its true power is $(o)input interception$().",
	"hexical.page.conjure_staff.2": "When I use my primary or secondary use keys with a staff in my main hand, it intercepts my click. Depending on the rank I assigned during creation, after that many clicks, it will cast the hex I gave it, starting the stack with false and true, corresponding to my left and right clicks respectively.",
	"hexical.page.conjure_staff.3": "The spell is not cheap, requiring a charged amethyst, the amount of media for the media battery, and an additional amethyst shard for every additional rank. However, the result allows for speedy and versatile casting, with infinitely more possibilities and no cooldown that other casting devices have."
